Topological Machine Learning in a Nutshell
==========================================

If you are reading this, you are probably wondering about what
topological machine learning can do for you and your projects.
The purpose of this page is to provide a pithy and coarse, but
hopefully *useful*, introduction to some concepts.

High-level View
---------------

If you are an expert in machine learning, you could summarise
topological machine learning as novel set of inductive biases
for models, making it possible to leverage properties such as
connectivity of data set. To some extent, such properties are
already covered by existing methods, but topology can be very
useful as an additional 'lens' through which to view data. In
graph learning tasks, for instance, being able to capture and
use topological features---such as *cycles*---is *crucial* in
order to improve predictive performance.
