    """Calculate persistence diagrams of an alpha complex.

    This module calculates persistence diagrams of an alpha complex,
    i.e. a subcomplex of the Delaunay triangulation, which is sparse
    and thus often substantially smaller than other complex.

    It was first described in [Edelsbrunner94]_ and is particularly
    useful when analysing low-dimensional data.

    Notes
    -----
    At the moment, this alpha complex implementation, following other
    implementations, provides *distance-based filtrations* only. This
    means that the resulting persistence diagrams do *not* correspond
    to the circumradius of a simplex.

    In addition, this implementation is **work in progress**. Some of
    the core features, such as handling of infinite features, are not
    available at the moment.

        """Implement forward pass for persistence diagram calculation.

        The forward pass entails calculating persistent homology on
        a point cloud and returning a set of persistence diagrams.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : array_like
            Input point cloud(s). `x` can either be a 2D array of shape
            `(n, d)`, which is treated as a single point cloud, or a 3D
            array/tensor of the form `(b, n, d)`, with `b` representing
            the batch size. Alternatively, you may also specify a list,
            possibly containing point clouds of non-uniform sizes.

        Returns
        -------
        list of :class:`PersistenceInformation`
            List of :class:`PersistenceInformation`, containing both the
            persistence diagrams and the generators, i.e. the
            *pairings*, of a certain dimension of topological features.
            If `x` is a 3D array, returns a list of lists, in which the
            first dimension denotes the batch and the second dimension
            refers to the individual instances of
            :class:`PersistenceInformation` elements.

            Generators will be represented in the persistence pairing
            based on proper creator--destroyer pairs of simplices. In
            dimension `k`, for instance, every generator is stored as
            a `k`-simplex followed by a `k+1` simplex.
